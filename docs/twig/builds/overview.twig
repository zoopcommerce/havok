<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Havok uses dojo's AMD loader to load modules, and has a handy ability to compile less client side. This makes development, unit testing and code reuse easy. However, it makes sites slow. An average havok page might load over 60+ separate javascript files, and compile 15 less files. All those requests take too long for a production environment.</p>

<p>Havok can utilize the dojo build system to create layers. Each layer consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A single compressed javascript file containing many AMD modules</li>
    <li>A compressed css file that contains all the compiled less for the layer</li>
</ul>

<p>To build havok layers you will require:
<ul>
    <li>node.js installed</li>
    <li>a <code>profile.js</code> that describes what should be built</li>
</ul>
